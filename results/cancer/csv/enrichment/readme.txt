# CSV files

Each file contains the -log10(p-value) of the enrichment for each pathway and for each optimal solution.
For each optimal network, the pathway enrichment was calculated using the one-sided fisher test
(hypergeometric test) and values were corrected using the B-H procedure for multiple comparisons.
