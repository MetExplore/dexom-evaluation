# Evaluation

This repository contains all the exported data produced for the evaluation, and the python notebooks used to plot the figures. The conda environment used to produce the figures is defined in `environment.yml`. However, the simplest way to prepare the environment using Python 3+ with pip and the `requirements.txt` file, included as well in the repository. First, create and activate a [new environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) and then run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run jupyter to load the notebooks to reproduce the figures (ipynb files)

```
jupyter notebook
```
